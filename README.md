Kaiser: The Card Game for iOS and Android source code.

This won't compile right out of the box because I had to remove a couple sensitive files. Also you're going to need the game engine at https://github.com/smellslikedonkey/DT3.git

The source code is released under the MIT license, but Smells Like Donkey Software Inc. retains the copyright on the art (except the face of the cards - see http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net).

Enjoy!
